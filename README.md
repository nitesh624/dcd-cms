```
    $ git clone <your_fork>
```

### Step 2] Local environment (DDEV) setup:

#### Pre-requisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- DDEV
- Make sure your ssh pub keys are added to dev server for db sync.

#### Drush Aliases
Use drush aliases to specifically target a local site. List of all aliases can
be found by running:
```
ddev drush sa
```
Lagoon aliases
```
ddev drush la
````
For finding out the URL of a site use the information in drush alias.

Current local aliases
- ddev.local - Use to target local site.

Lagoon aliases
- lagoon.dcd-develop - Dev env
- lagoon.dcd-main - Prod env

#### 2.1] Run the following command to setup project

- `ddev start`
